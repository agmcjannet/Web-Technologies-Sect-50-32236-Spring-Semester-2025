### Week 2 Readme Response - Allison McJannet 

This project, "Froggy's Big Day Out," is a "choose your own adventure" story made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At first, I had ChatGPT create the assignment for me, but I didn't really understand what it had done. The story and the code felt impersonal and not like something I would create. I decided to take some of the suggestions from ChatGPT, especially about using if statements, variables, and DOM manipulation, but I wanted to do most of the work on my own so I could understand it better and explain what was going on. It was a challenge, but it helped me learn a lot as I worked through it.

One of my biggest successes was getting the story to flow properly. After adding the if statements to control the different paths in the story, everything started to come together. I also used external CSS to add images, colors, and fonts, making the story look nice. The choices work well, and the story moves along based on what the user picks. Even though there were some frustrating moments, I was happy to see it all work in the end.

The biggest challenges were fitting everything into the assignment requirements after starting with something a little different. It was tricky to add the if statements and variables, and sometimes the story text or images wouldn’t update as expected. I also had to fix a lot of bugs where buttons weren’t working right. It took a lot of time and patience, but I broke the code down into smaller parts and tested each one, which helped me fix the issues and make the story work.
