### Week 4 Readme Response - Allison McJannet 

For this assignment, I asked ChatGPT to generate some code for me for the assignment, like stated in the homework requirements. I thought it might save time, but in the end, I didn’t use any of the code because it wasn’t at all like my own story. I wanted to build on the story I had already started about Froggy, not start from scratch. However, the code was still helpful. It gave me ideas for how to structure the choices and how to use loops, and more efficient functions. I hadn’t considered using a loop for possible choices and then an error screen, so that part of the code was useful.

The functions in the code also helped me see how to organize different story branches. For example, I didn’t know how to structure the part where the story changes depending on what the player types instead of pushing a button. Looking at the code gave me a clearer understanding of how to do that. It also showed me how to update the story, change images, and update the background color when the player makes a choice in more simple ways. This was something I hadn’t known fully how to do, and was helpful in meeting the assignment requirements. 

In the end, while I didn’t use the code directly, it helped me learn more about the things I needed for the assignment. It showed me how to organize my code better and gave me useful ideas for structuring my story. I feel more confident now that I have a better understanding of how to implement these things myself.
