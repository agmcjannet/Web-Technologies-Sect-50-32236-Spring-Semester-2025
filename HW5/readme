### Week 5 Readme Response - Allison McJannet 

For this assignment, I spent the majority of my time working on creating interesting custom formatting and design for the memory/matching game. I focused on making the website visually appealing, which included creating custom fronts and backs for the cards in Canva. This involved researching various formatting techniques from places like W3Schools, selecting fonts that were cute and fun, going along with the theme, and experimenting with different layouts to create a playful and engaging design. The challenge of aligning the aesthetic aspects of the game with its functionality and arrays kept me super engaged. 

At the end of the process, I used AI to generate its version of the homework. What I found interesting was how AI approached the structure and functionality of the game. While it didn't offer a design that had the same custom formatting I spent most of my time on, the way it handled the functionality of the game, such as managing the arrays and randomization, was helpful to compare my own code to. Even thought I didn't directly use any of the AI-generated code, it was helpful to see how I could focus more on the mechanics of the game and simplify some sections of my code. In the end, the AI's version didn't really change my final product, but it provided me with a useful perspective on the problem-solving process, showing, like in the previous weeks, that there are multiple ways to approach the same assignment.
