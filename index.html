                <p>Hi! I'm Allison (she/her), a fourth-year student/Senior in my last semester, double major in Art and Media Arts,
                from Helena, Montana. I'm a third generation Griz, love reading and anything crafty (especially felt ornaments
                at the moment), and am a die-hard Griz football fan.</p> 

                <p>I have experience in graphic design, Yearbook creation, social media management, and have a strong focus on
                creative problem solving and visual storytelling using Adobe Creative Suite. I love working with Illustrator and
                Photoshop to create visually appealing artworks that express my point of view.</p> 

                <p>I am passionate about community engagement and am volunteering with the University of Montana Advocates, the
                student ambassadors on campus, as well as working with them to run The Big Sky Experience, previously named New
                Student Orientation. I have also been recognized for my service, including honors like Phi Kappa Phi and Mortar 
                Board inductions</p>

                <div>
                    <div class="menu-item">My artwork is often a journey through the themes of identity, tradition, 
                        and the landscapes that have shaped my life. Many pieces I've created in my college career reflect my deep connection 
                        to the University of Montana, my Montana roots, and the personal symbols that have informed my artistic voice. 
                        From the comfort of my pets to the rugged wilderness, I explore themes of belonging, memory, and growth through 
                        diverse mediums, including painting, printmaking, digital illustration,
                        and animation. </div>

                <div>
                    <div class="menu-item">Recurring motifs, such as cats, bears, and other Montana wildlife, serve as symbols of both personal 
                        history and the natural world. The bear, for example, represents my connection to both the University and my family, 
                        while cats evoke comfort and companionship. These elements merge to tell a story of home, community, and the 
                        transformative experiences I've had while at UM. </div>

                    <div class="menu-item">The works I've created, though varied in medium and style, share a common thread: they are all 
                        expressions of my evolving relationship with place, family, and the stories that shape my life. Together, they form 
                        a narrative of artistic growth, personal exploration, and the enduring beauty of the world around me. My personal 
                        experience, including the landscapes, animals, and memories I have inspire my work.</div>

        <div class="menu-group-container">

            <div class="menu-group">

                <div class="menu-head"></div>
                <div>
                    <div class="menu-item">The interactive story video game, Florence, left a lasting impression on me because 
                        of how it resonated with me emotionally. As I played, I felt a connection to the main character, Florence, 
                        who was navigating the highs and lows of relationships, rediscovering herself, and personal growth. 
                        The simple interactive puzzle mechanics made me feel involved in the story, increasing the emotional 
                        weight of each moment. The color palette and music reflected Florence's emotional journey, shifting from 
                        light and joyful to sad during difficult moments. It was a game that made me reflect on the importance of 
                        self-love and personal passions.  </div>

                <div>
                    <div class="menu-item">One moment that stands out was the chapter “Let Go,” where Florence found fulfillment in 
                        her art instead of relying on a romantic relationship. This transformation felt really satisfying, and I 
                        realized it was a personal lesson in valuing oneself and one's passions. The way the game combined emotional 
                        storytelling with gameplay made each chapter feel meaningful, and the end left me feeling relieved and 
                        fulfilled. It made me think about how, in our world today, many people struggle with balancing relationships 
                        and personal growth. Florence highlighted the importance of taking time to rediscover what makes us happy.  </div>

                    <div class="menu-item">Games like Florence can help us confront things like our emotional well-being, self-identity, 
                        and personal growth. By showing relatable stories through interactive and immersive experiences, games can create 
                        empathy and understanding. The game Florence's depiction of Florence's emotional journey showed how games could 
                        explore themes of self-love and personal growth in a way that might resonate with players. I believe this kind of 
                        story can help us see some of the emotional struggles people face, providing not just entertainment but also 
                        understanding. </div>
