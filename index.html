                <h1>Quick Bio</h1>
                <p>Hi! I'm Allison (she/her), a fourth-year student/Senior in my last semester, double major in Art and Media Arts,
                from Helena, Montana. I'm a third generation Griz, love reading and anything crafty (especially felt ornaments
                at the moment), and am a die-hard Griz football fan.</p> 

                <p>I have experience in graphic design, Yearbook creation, social media management, and have a strong focus on
                creative problem solving and visual storytelling using Adobe Creative Suite. I love working with Illustrator and
                Photoshop to create visually appealing artworks that express my point of view.</p> 

                <p>I am passionate about community engagement and am volunteering with the University of Montana Advocates, the
                student ambassadors on campus, as well as working with them to run The Big Sky Experience, previously named New
                Student Orientation. I have also been recognized for my service, including honors like Phi Kappa Phi and Mortar 
                Board inductions</p>

                        to the University of Montana, my Montana roots, and the personal symbols that have informed my artistic voice. 
                        From the comfort of my pets to the rugged wilderness, I explore themes of belonging, memory, and growth through 
                        diverse mediums, including painting, printmaking, digital illustration,

                        while cats evoke comfort and companionship. These elements merge to tell a story of home, community, and the
